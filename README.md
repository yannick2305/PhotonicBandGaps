Code supporting the numerical computations of arXiv: TODO

The **Run files** are calles:
  - OneD_(...).m
  - TwoD_(...).m
  - ThreeD(...).m

These **Run files** are responsible for executing simulations of resonator systems in their respective dimensionalities.

All other files in the repository define reusable functions used by the run files for various calculations and processes.
